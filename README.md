A Node.js Express application that utilizes the EJS templating engine and integrates with Auth0.com for authentication via Google and GitHub accounts. The primary feature of the application is its ability to search for images using the Google Custom Search API, restricted to results from Unsplash.com.

Users can authenticate with their Google or GitHub accounts to access the image search functionality. Upon logging in, they can enter search queries to find images from Unsplash.com and view them directly within the application.

One of the standout features of the application is the ability for users to save their favorite images to a personalized favorites list. This list is stored in a JSON file and is accessible only to the logged-in user. Users can easily look at their saved favorite images.
